;; On Saturday morning, inspired by Andrew Moylan’s article on Wolfram’s Blog, I sat down to work out a simulation of
;; the knockout stage of the World Cup competition. I used the bracket shown at right, and found elo ratings of the
;; sixteen teams, as of that morning, at Wikipedia:
;; 
;;  1 BRA Brazil        2082
;;  2 ESP Spain         2061
;;  3 NED Netherlands   2045                        Uruguay                   Argentina
;;  4 ARG Argentina     1966                        Korea                        Mexico
;;  5 ENG England       1945                        
;;  6 GER Germany       1930                        United States               Germany
;;  7 URU Uruguay       1890                        Ghana                       England
;;  8 CHI Chile         1883                                                  
;;  9 POR Portugal      1874                                                  
;; 10 MEX Mexico        1873                        Netherlands                Paraguay
;; 15 USA United States 1785                        Slovakia                      Japan
;; 19 PAR Paraguay      1771                                                  
;; 25 KOR Korea         1746                        Brazil                        Spain
;; 26 JPN Japan         1744                        Chile                      Portugal
;; 32 GHA Ghana         1711
;; 45 SVK Slovakia      1654
;; 
;; The table shows that there are forty-four national teams with ratings higher than Slovakia’s rating of 1654; they are
;; lucky to be in the tournament.
;; 
;; The likelihood that a team will win its match can be computed from the elo rankings of the team and its opponent
;; according to the formula:
;;
;;     1 / (1 + 10^( (their-rating - our-rating)/400 ))
;;
;; Thus, the United States had a 60.5% expectation of winning its match against Ghana this afternoon, and Ghana had a
;; 39.5% expectation of defeating the United States. Harrumph!
;; 
;; Every time a match is played, the elo rating of a team changes. The amount of the change is based on the actual
;; result as compared to the expected result. If a team wins when they have a high expectation of winning, their elo
;; rating goes up by a small amount, since they were expected to win. However, if a team wins when they have a low
;; expectation of winning, their elo rating goes up by a large amount. The formula is:
;;
;;     new-rating = old-rating + KG(W - We)
;;
;; where K is a weighting for the importance of the game (K is 60 for the World Cup), G is a parameter based on the goal
;; differential (we’ll assume that all games are won by a single goal, so G = 1), W is 1 for a win and 0 for a loss, and
;; We is the winning expectation calculated by the formula given above.
;; 
;; Your task is to use the data and formulas described above to simulate the knockout stage of the World Cup a million
;; times and report the number of times each nation wins. When you are finished, you are welcome to read or run a
;; suggested solution, or to post your own solution or discuss the exercise in the comments below.

;; Solution
;;
;; I've done ELO calculations before and this looked like fun. We can represent the tournament as a tree, in which case
;; the evaluation of the brackets is just a depth-first walk. The code ends up being quite clean, I think, but it isn't
;; particularly fast. Simulating a million games takes just under a minute on my laptop. We do calculate the new rating
;; of the loser which isn't strictly necessary for the solution, but I think it's the right thing to do.
