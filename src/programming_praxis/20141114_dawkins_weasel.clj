;; In his book The Blind Watchmaker, Richard Dawkins says:
;;
;;    I don’t know who it was first pointed out that, given enough time, a monkey bashing away at random on a typewriter
;;    could produce all the works of Shakespeare. The operative phrase is, of course, given enough time. Let us limit
;;    the task facing our monkey somewhat. Suppose that he has to produce, not the complete works of Shakespeare but
;;    just the short sentence ‘Methinks it is like a weasel’, and we shall make it relatively easy by giving him a
;;    typewriter with a restricted keyboard, one with just the 26 (capital) letters, and a space bar. How long will he
;;    take to write this one little sentence?
;;
;; (All of our quotes are shamelessly stolen from Wikipedia.) Then Dawkins suggests that this is a bad analogy for
;; evolution, and proposes this alternative:
;;
;;    We again use our computer monkey, but with a crucial difference in its program. It again begins by choosing a
;;    random sequence of 28 letters, just as before … it duplicates it repeatedly, but with a certain chance of random
;;    error – ‘mutation’ – in the copying. The computer examines the mutant nonsense phrases, the ‘progeny’ of the
;;    original phrase, and chooses the one which, however slightly, most resembles the target phrase, METHINKS IT IS
;;    LIKE A WEASEL.
;;
;; Then he discusses a computer program that simulates his monkey, which he says took half an hour to run because it was
;; written BASIC; when he rewrote his program in Pascal the runtime dropped to eleven seconds. His program used this
;; algorithm:
;;
;; - Start with a random string of 28 characters.
;; - Make 100 copies of the string (reproduce).
;; - For each character in each of the 100 copies, with a probability of 5%, replace (mutate) the character with a new
;;   random character.
;; - Compare each new string with the target string “METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL”, and give each a score (the number of
;;   letters in the string that are correct and in the correct position).
;; - If any of the new strings has a perfect score (28), halt. Otherwise, take the highest scoring string, and go to
;;   step 2.

;; Solution

;; Represent the string as a vector for easy access
