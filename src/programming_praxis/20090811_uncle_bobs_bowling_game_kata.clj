;; Someone mentioned Uncle Bob's Bowling Game Kata to me a few days ago; it is apparently famous as a tutorial on
;; object-oriented programming and test-driven development, though I had never heard of either Uncle Bob or his Bowling
;; Game Kata.
;; 
;; A game of tenpins bowling lasts ten frames, in each of which the bowler makes one or two attempts to knock down ten
;; pins arranged in a triangle. If the bowler knocks down all ten pins on the first attempt (that's called a "strike"),
;; he scores ten pins plus the number of pins knocked down on his next two rolls. If the bowler knocks down all ten pins
;; after two attempts (that's called a "spare"), he scores ten pins plus the number of pins knocked down on his next
;; roll. If the bowler fails to knock down all ten pins (that's called an "open frame"), he scores the number of pins he
;; knocked down. The scores accumulate through all ten frames. At the last frame, if necessary, the pins are reset for
;; one or two additional rolls to count the final bonus. The sample scoresheet below shows how the calculations work:
;; 
;;      1 4 | 4 5 | 6 / | 5 / |   X | 0 1 | 7 / | 6 / |   X | 2 / 6
;;        5 |  14 |  29 |  49 |  60 |  61 |  77 |  97 | 117 | 133
;; 
;; For instance, the score in the second frame is 9, the sum of the two balls in the open frame. The score in the third
;; frame is 15, which is 10 for the spare plus 5 on the next ball. The score in the ninth frame is 20, which is 10 for
;; the strike plus 10 for the spare on the first two balls of the tenth frame. The score in the tenth frame is 16, which
;; is 10 for the spare plus 6 for the extra ball, which is a bonus ball not really part of any frame (the two balls of
;; the tenth frame have already been rolled).
;; 
;; Your task is to write a function that calculates the score of a tenpins bowling game. When you are finished, you are
;; welcome to read or run a suggested solution, or to post your solution or discuss the exercise in the comments below.

;; Solution
;;
;; I wasn't quite clear on how to score bowling based on the above description, so here's a bit more clarification from
;; the web:
;;
;;     Scoring bowling
;;
;;     The game consists of 10 frames as shown above. In each frame the player has two opportunities to knock down 10
;;     pins. The score for the frame is the total number of pins knocked down, plus bonuses for strikes and spares.
;; 
;;     A spare is when the player knocks down all 10 pins in two tries. The bonus for that frame is the number of pins
;;     knocked down by the next roll. So in frame 3 above, the score is 10 (the total number knocked down) plus a bonus
;;     of 5 (the number of pins knocked down on the next roll.)
;; 
;;     A strike is when the player knocks down all 10 pins on his first try. The bonus for that frame is the value of
;;     the next two balls rolled.
;; 
;;     In the tenth frame a player who rolls a spare or strike is allowed to roll the extra balls to complete the frame.
;;     However no more than three balls can be rolled in tenth frame.
;;
;; I TDD'ed the solution until the spare use-case came up, at which point I had to refactor and bascially rewrite it
;; all. I played with a few ways of creating and scoring frames and games lazily, but it seems like the clearest way is
;; to just loop until the game is done and assume zero if there are fewer rolls provided than required.

(defn spare?
  ([rolls]
    (= 10 (reduce + (take 2 rolls)))))

(defn strike?
  ([rolls]
    (= 10 (first rolls))))

(defn score-game
  ([rolls]
    (loop [ frame 1
            score 0
            rolls rolls ]
      (cond
        (empty? rolls)  score
        (> frame 10)    score
        (spare? rolls)  (recur (inc frame) (reduce + score (take 3 rolls)) (drop 2 rolls))
        (strike? rolls) (recur (inc frame) (reduce + score (take 3 rolls)) (drop 1 rolls))
        :else           (recur (inc frame) (reduce + score (take 2 rolls)) (drop 2 rolls))))))
