;; In the mid-1980’s, Mark V. Shaney posted messages such as this to the Usenet group net.singles:
;; 
;;     I seem to be important. For me, it would have agreed with the
;;     technical insight that is dear to me. Because of this, I have no
;;     advice for someone in that situation!
;; 
;;     Joining Mensa was something I did him one better. I wore a dress skirt
;;     a day for one week. I did him one better. I wore a dress skirt a day
;;     for a 2 year relationship. I’m wondering if anyone else out there has
;;     ever experienced this phenomena, whether it was actually your
;;     contention that this is true for me.
;; 
;;     I suppose it depends how you felt about someone before you became
;;     emotionally attached and therefore “safer” – not to sporting events,
;;     but to opera.
;; 
;;     I lost 90 lbs a few months during my “flower child” days in high school
;;     where, due to her high academic standings, was shunned by many of the
;;     tube. The experience really screwed them up — if not their heads,
;;     their knees. Why does one have to be the prime measurement of
;;     manhood. No?
;; 
;;     He was a scrawny, spastic nerd in high school, and I fantasized about
;;     such a thing. It all depends on the sidelines, listening to what makes
;;     the rest of the guys around her – suddenly finds herself in a situation
;;     where guys are asking them out!? But this can result in members of
;;     either the person of your dreams (in a larger number of males to
;;     females studying the field of engineering), the ratio of males to
;;     females is somewhere in the past. And, per the other person.
;; 
;;     I find it hard to reconcile the notion that something or someone isn’t
;;     theirs anymore. I have a date with the woman. Subjectively, I have
;;     also acted in this weekend.
;; 
;; However, Shaney wasn’t a person. Shaney was a bot created by three Bell Labs researchers — Bruce Ellis, Rob Pike and
;; Don Mitchell — that analyzed Usenet postings and then created its own posting. Shaney’s writings were quirky,
;; non-sensical, and beloved by many.
;; 
;; Shaney worked by reading a training text and saving each triple of words that appear in the training text in a large
;; table. Then it generates text using a markov chain, starting with two words that appear in the training text and
;; repeatedly writing the third word of the triple, sliding the output window from word to word. The genius of the
;; method is that any two words may appear in the training text with multiple following words, and the generator is free
;; to choose any of them; thus, short fragments of text make sense, but the text as a whole frequently veers from one
;; train of thought to another. A word includes its surrounding punctuation, so that sentence structure and, indirectly,
;; grammar, are built in to the output.
;; 
;; Write a program that implements Shaney.

;; Solution
;;
;; This was pretty fun. I wanted to make the text a little more realistic, so I weight the triples so more frequently
;; occurring triples are more likely to be selected. Feeding in some Lovecraft as the initial text results in some
;; rather insane ravings.
;;
;;     I insisted upon talking--nervously and elaborately explaining my condition. I told him of dreams for want of
;;     continuous context. Today I refuse to form a start that, even should I succeed in finding the door I had warned
;;     their company to a curious, sickly yellow-grey, and over again, and I screamed, but my eyes and the white fungous
;;     growths which occasionally appeared; these, and the legacy of eon-old Leng, and the search I had no better
;;     informed than he.
